% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

\section{Introduction}
With hundreds of millions of tweets every day, the popular microblogging service Twitter has become a probe to real human behavior an opinions around the globe. The Twitter 'corpus' reflects political and social trends, popular culture, global and local happenings, and much more. In addition, Twitter 'tweets' are easy to access and aggregate. Therefore, we experience an increased interest in natural language processing research of Twitter data.

However, Twitter 'tweets' have some unique features that differ from traditional corpura (such as WSJ) and that should be taken into consideration when implementing natural language processing techniques.



Here's a tweet: \tweet{This is an example for a tweet}
